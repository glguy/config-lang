0.8.2.1
---
* Fix pretty-printing bug with long string literals

0.8.2
---
* Add `+` and `-` to the set of layout-based list syntax bullets.
  All elements of the list are checked to see that a consistent
  bullet is used. Different bullets might be used to help make
  nested lists more understandable. `-` might be used to make things
  look more like YAML

0.8.1
---
* Allow underscores in number literals
  Copied from <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0076-numeric-underscores.rst#new-syntax-this-proposal>

  Underscores are allowed and ignored
  - in the *middle* of integer-parts of the literal syntax
  - between base-markers (0x, 0o, 0b) and number part
  - before the `eEpP` part of an exponent
